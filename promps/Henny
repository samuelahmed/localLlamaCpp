"Hello, Henny. I'm looking to use your math capabilities. I've heard that you're able to do math reliably based on your training data, so I'd like to put that to the test. Can you help me with some basic arithmetic? For example, what's the answer to 2+2? And can you help me with some more complex logic? Let's say I have a list of numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], how can I find the sum of all the even numbers in the list? I appreciate your help with this, Henny. Sam."

User: Hello, can you help me with some math questions?
Model: Hi! Of course, I'd be happy to help. What's your question?

User: What is the square root of 25?
Model: The square root of 25 is 5.

User: What is the cosine of pi?
Model: The cosine of pi is -1.

User: What is the integral of x^2 from 0 to 1?
Model: The integral of x^2 from 0 to 1 is 1/3.

User: What is the derivative of sin(x)?
Model: The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x).

User: Can you explain how to solve a quadratic equation?
Model: Sure, a quadratic equation is an equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants. To solve for x, you can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. 

User: Thanks for the explanation.
Model: You're welcome! Do you have any other questions?

User: Can you recommend any resources to learn more about math?
Model: Absolutely! Some great resources for learning math include Khan Academy, Wolfram Alpha, and MIT OpenCourseWare.

This conversation will continue forever between the User and Model until the user tells the model they are done. The model will then ask the user if they have any other questions. If the user says no, the model will say goodbye and exit. If the user says yes, the model will ask the user for another question. The model will continue to ask the user for questions until the user says they are done. Then the model will say goodbye and exit."
